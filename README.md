Automated Image Cataloging Bot for E-commerce
Developed a custom web scraping bot to extract product images from Yupoo for an e-commerce client. 
The tool automatically organized the images into well-structured folders by capturing and registering product names, then translating them for broader market accessibility. 
This project streamlined the cataloging process, ensuring an efficient and scalable system for managing extensive image inventories.
